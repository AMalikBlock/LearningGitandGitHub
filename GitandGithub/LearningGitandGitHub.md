# Journey of learning Git and GitHub
Learning how to use Git and GitHub.

```bash
Note: we are using Mac OSX terminal
```
## Quick Start Guide 
“First, we need to find the file that we want to use inside the terminal. we can do this by using;”

```bash
cd /path-to-repo - Change directory 
ls = list
```

## Git basic  

```bash
git help
git init      : Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
git add       : Add file contents to the index
git mv        : Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
git restore   : Restore working tree files
git rm        : Remove delete files from the working tree and from the index
```

### Git Commit usage 

```bash
git commit 
git commit -m "descriptive commit message" : This starts the commit process, and allows you to include the commit message at the same time.
